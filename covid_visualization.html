<h3>Description of Data</h3>
<p>COVID data comes from the 11/09/20 update of the NYC Health Department’s <a href="https://github.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data">GitHub repository</a>. The data does not contain information on probable cases and deaths, only those which are confirmed. Geographic information is captured using modified ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTA), which combines census blocks with smaller populations to allow more stable estimates of population size for rate calculations. The ZCTA geography was developed by the U.S. Census Bureau.</p>
<p>Race of householder by ZCTA was gathered from the <a href="https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?g=0400000US36.871000&amp;tid=DECENNIALSF12010.H6&amp;hidePreview=false&amp;vintage=2010&amp;layer=VT_2010_040_00_PY_D1&amp;cid=P001001">2010 U.S. Census</a>. While this is somewhat outdated, we can still use the proportions to get a decent idea of the race breakdown within each ZCTA.</p>

<p>Testing the correlation coefficient, we obtain a Rho of -0.38 and an associated p-value of <span class="math inline">\(2.2*10^{-7}\)</span>. This indicates that case rate is negatively correlated with proportion of white householders in the ZCTA, and the correlation is statistically significant. A higher case rate is associated with a lower proportion of white householders.</p>

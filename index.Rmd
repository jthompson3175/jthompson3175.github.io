## About Me 

<img src="hip.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right:20px"  width="300"/>

I graduated with my BSPH in Biostatistics from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 2018. I remain a devoted basketball fan and involved alumna. My time at UNC fostered my understanding of the coupling of statistics and health. 

Currently, I am attending Columbia University for my M.S. in Biostatistics, focusing on theory and methods. I have experience in managing large data sets both in R and SAS. My focus is in statistical analysis and data management, with the goal of improving public health. I am familiar with the theory behind statistical analysis as well as applications and computing practice.

## Sample Projects Overview

There are three sample projects provided above, which give some idea of my data management and visualization capabilities. The restaurant inspections and opioid epidemic analyses include my code, which can me revealed by clicking the _code_ buttom on the right side of the page.  

First, I explored [restaurant inspections](plotly.html) in New York. This data was publicly available, and I was primarily interested in looking at how scores differed by borough over time. How many and what proportion of boroughs got A's, B's, and C's? Did this change between 2013 to 2017? The dataset contains information on the description of the restaurant's violation, so I also looked into the proportion that mentioned _vermin_ in the violation. 

Additionally, I investivated trends trends in the [opioid epidemic](opioids.html) in New York from a demographic standpoint, as part of a larger project. The opioid epidemic is a national crisis. Every day in the U.S., more than 130 people die from an opioid overdose. I focused on opioid-related deaths, categorizing by gender, race, age group, and county.

Finally, I created a [crime dashboard](dashboard.html) to show crime in Chicago in 2018. There is a heat map, which provides insight into the areas of the city with more crime, as well as a marked map of specific crime incidents. In the lower right of the dashboard, there is a bar chart showing the raw numbers of the different types of crimes committed.

## About Me  

<img src=images/professional_pic_small.jpg>

I graduated with my BSPH in Biostatistics from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 2018. I remain a devoted basketball fan and involved alumna.  

I am currently attending Columbia University for my M.S. in Biostatistics, focusing on theory and methods. I have experience in managing large data sets both in R and SAS. My focus is in statistical analysis and data management, specifically in the clinical trial setting. I am familiar with the theory behind statistical analysis as well as applications and computing practice.
